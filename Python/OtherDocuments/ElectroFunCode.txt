https://github.com/Taher1322/RPi-bluetooth_app

This repository receives the data from Andriod bluetooth app and performs the task as defined in the code

Follow the steps to get the project working:

Step 1: You need to have a full version OS booted in your Pi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unc1pwreJLo

Step 2: Once the booting is done just clone the respository

Step 3: Just download the Bluetooth and GPIO required packages files by these commands sudo apt-get install python-bluetooth sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio

Step 4 : Run the file which is there in the repository with the python extension

Step 5: Download the Pi3 Bluetooth app from Playstore connect your Bluetooth with RPi Bluetooth

Step 6: Send the commands to control the LED
