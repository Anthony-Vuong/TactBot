# TactBotü§ñ
Wireless robot project that uses bluetooth from Android device to communicate with a RPI4. The RPI4 will interface
with an RC Car through the GPIO PWM Signals. Commands will be sent through Android bluetooth protocol. To access the manifest, 
main activity, and design file use the following path: App-Src-Main

‚úîÔ∏è04/07/2021: Successfully integrated Elecgrow display to RPI4. 

‚úîÔ∏è04/08/2021: Conducting power tests with Metecsmart PowerBank. Goals for power test:

  - [x] Avoid burning the RPI4
  - [x] Run for 1 hour >
  - [x] Powerbank provides enough supply to RPI4  
  
  üí° Future testing - running scripts with multiple peripherals
