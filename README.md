# TactBotü§ñ
Wireless robot project that uses bluetooth from Android device to communicate with a RPI4. The RPI4 will interface
with an RC Car through the GPIO PWM Signals. Commands will be sent through Android bluetooth protocol. To access the manifest, 
main activity, and design file use the following path: App-Src-Main

‚úîÔ∏è04/15/2021: The following link will help in a huge in milestone on the project. Thank you Electrofun! Here is link:  [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NddZnd95cyE)

‚úîÔ∏è05/24/2021: New route taken to control RPI4 through Android App and Bluetooth: Android App -> Bluetooth -> HC06 -> RPI4; SUCCESS with new approach - Able to send messages from App to RPI4!

‚úîÔ∏è05/31/2021: Switching App Acitivites problems. Will develop all controls on one activity for now. Creating serial script to command rover.

‚úîÔ∏è06/03/2021: App updates: Adding rover controls to connectivity page. Activity life cycle research needed for multi activity app.

‚úîÔ∏è06/18/2021: Created documentation for code - not completely updated.

‚úîÔ∏è06/21/2021: Created driver file for rover.

‚úîÔ∏è06/23/2021: Tested Bluetooth signal with RPI4 PWM with success - getting rid of timeout for serial port. Git repo on RPI4 created. Project meeting on 6/22.

‚úîÔ∏è07/01/2021: Hardware connections for RPI4 and Traxxas Stampede RC Car  [Link Here](https://projects.digilentinc.com/surrogatetv/internet-controlled-rc-car-with-hd-video-using-raspberry-pi-4b728c)

‚úîÔ∏è07/22/2021: Traxxas Stampede connected to RPI4 pwm pins through jumper wires. Steering servo can be controlled. The ESC (electronic speed control) is having troubling accepting pwm signals from RPI4. Computer vision is installed on RPI4 and can detect a person, pretty cool. Need to train to find target, a red circle for our project.

‚úîÔ∏è07/23/2021: Training model procedure for Tensorflow for windows 10 then to Tensorflow lite for RPI4: .[Link LINK](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi)

Added a portfolio for Tactbot at this .[Link LINK](https://avuong04.bitbucket.io/)

‚úîÔ∏è07/27/2021: Finally found Arduino hidden in electronics case. Conducting PWM testing with traxxas rc car. 

‚úîÔ∏è07/29/2021: Found an [article](http://www.remotebits.com/index.php/2017/12/06/how-to-read-the-traxxas-radio-pwm-signals-using-an-arduino/) to help reading pwm with an Arduino.

‚úîÔ∏è07/30/2021: It seems the pwm values the arduino is reading from pulseIn() function is the following: throttle forward(1490-1981), reverse(991-1490), straight(1490-1500), left(1490-1980), right(991-1490)

‚úîÔ∏è08/05/2021: No luck programming ESC xl-5 for Traxxas RC Car. Big Picture Decision: Buying Elecrow Chassis as base for rover feature. In the mean time developing
OpenCV and training with RPI Camera.

‚úîÔ∏è08/06/2021: RPI Camera now has color tracking capability. Tested on orange inhaler and was for the most part able track it if held at a certain angle. May need a larger object. Testing Pan Tilt Hat, seems to work from commandline. Waiting on parts from Pimoroni to mount camera to hat. 

‚úîÔ∏è08/08/2021: Testing color tracing - original test object (orange inhaler) was no longer detected by openCV. Weird since it worked the previous night - may have to do with 
the lighting and color shading. Switched to a purple cup, but openCV detected it as more of blue color. Making a change RGB/HSV change helped openCV detect and trace the cup.

‚úîÔ∏è08/09/2021: Still waiting on more parts. Battery powering motor controller is possible with Duracell battery and 12v battery pack. Will test spinning motor to see how it holds up. Also, pan tilt hat is now programmed to center object when tracking. Slow, but functional.

‚úîÔ∏è08/09/2021: Updated portfolio. Still waiting for rc parts. Note, we are working without encoder, so using this [link](https://maker.pro/raspberry-pi/tutorial/how-to-control-a-dc-motor-with-an-l298-controller-and-raspberry-pi) might help. Will need to to test rpm to distance measures.

‚úîÔ∏è08/11/2021: Rover features updated to work with DC motor with no encoder. Not tested yet.

‚úîÔ∏è08/12/2021: Rover updated with steering and throttle. Not tested yet as parts are not in yet.

‚úîÔ∏è08/30/2021: Parts to complete Rover are in - will assemble by end of today. As well as work on multi-processing/threading motor. Should I work on joystick for app?

‚úîÔ∏è09/02/2021: Small app updates - can now receive and display messages. Rover updates - multiprocessing 2 motors. Need to design mounting hardware for all devices.

‚úîÔ∏è09/03/2021: Further updates for app and Rover. 

‚úîÔ∏è09/07/2021: Rover basic functions implemented - in testing. Turret currently in development.

‚úîÔ∏è09/09/2021: Joystick testing, updates to throttle and steer controls. Mounting all components together - working on the ERGO!

‚úîÔ∏è09/12/2021: More updates for Joystick in TactBot App

‚úîÔ∏è09/13/2021: Git test  - RPI4 Git working again. Rover feature basic functionality tested - is good! Working on turret class - implementing camera and detection system. Calling newest update v1.1

‚úîÔ∏è09/15/2021: v1.4 Updates: Turret Feature module tested - not smooth but works! Will implement to Tactbot System tomorrow.

‚úîÔ∏è09/16/2021: v1.7 Turret succesffuly implemented into tactbot system. Needs fine tuning but functional.

‚úîÔ∏è09/17/2021: v1.9 - Ready to demo - using App, throttle and steering control, turret scan. 

Future plans:
            
                    - Wireless communcation, no bluetooth, switch to using RPI as network Access Point
                    - Implementing Nucleo MCU to control sensors
                    - Using Nucleo to include distance sensors and angular sensor(Gyroscope)
                    - Switching from Android Smartphone to Android Tablet - more room for joystick controls
                    - Provide night vision for stealth operations and a led light for low light areas.
                    
‚úîÔ∏è09/21/2021: Laser beam testing on purple balloons. If doesn't pop atleast it'll look cool. 

‚úîÔ∏è09/22/2021: Received Arducam dual camera adapter and v1 Pi Cam. Waiting on Pimoroni Neopixel led lamp and night vision camera. Giving TactBot darkness/stealth feature.

‚úîÔ∏è09/30/2021: Writing up some module for light feature. New IDEA: Add a light detecting system - LDR! Switching from Duracell AA batteries to Lipo batteries might be a good idea - since they are light; but can we connect them in series?
